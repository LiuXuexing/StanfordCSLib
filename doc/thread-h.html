 * Function: waitThread
 * Usage: waitThread(lock);
 * ------------------------
 * Waits for some other thread to issue a call to signalThread on this
 * lock.  This call requires that the lock be owned by the calling thread. 
 * The effect of this function is to release the lock and then wait until
 * the desired signalThread operation occurs, at which point the lock is
 * reacquired and control passes to the statement following the waitThread.
 *
 * The waitThread function is useful only if the call is embedded inside a
 * while loop that checks a condition before proceeding.  That while
 * statement must itself be embedded inside a synchronized statement that
 * acquires the lock.  Thus, the standard paradigm for using the waitThread
 * function looks like this:
 *
 *    synchronized (lock) {
 *        while (conditional test) {
 *            waitThread(lock);
