# StanfordCSLib
Library of Java-like tools implemented for C.

<p>This directory contains the code for the Stanford CSLib tools implemented
for C. The subdirectories have the following contents:</p>

<pre>
   bin/       The gccx script used to simplify compilation
   doc/       The HTML documentation for the package
   examples/  Several examples illustrating the use of graphics
   include/   The header files (all compilations need a path to these)
   lib/       The output location of the libcs.a archive
   obj/       The object files
   src/       The C source files
</pre>

The cstest program produced by the Makefile tests the non-graphics code.
